I love Amarok, since the beginning. But I have had issues since I moved from <code>awesome</code> (and didn't knew it was coincidence) with my multimedia keys.

Today I discovered a script called <a href="http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=103448">Gnome Multimedia Keys 2</a> for Amarok2 and now I got it working again, after trying with Banshee, Rhytmbox, Songbird, Exaile... I went back to Amarok :D
