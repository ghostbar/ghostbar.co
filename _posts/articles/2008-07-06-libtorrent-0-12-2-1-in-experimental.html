Yey! libtorrent 0.12.2-1 is now uploaded to experimental (thanks <a href="http://bureado.com.ve">bureado</a> for the sponsoring! :D), soon I'll get rtorrent 0.8.2-1 uploaded as well.

I've been using it since a while and has been working great!

In a few hours the buildd network should get them built for all arches, BTW, in this version is included the support for ARM-based machines :) Prepare your NSLU2!
