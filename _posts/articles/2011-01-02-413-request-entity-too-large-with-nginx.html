I'm working on a big site, importing a lot of files to a WordPress installation and started to get a bunch of 413's. After a little bit of googling I found out what was happening:

What needs to be done is on <code>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</code> write:
<pre>http {
    client_max_body_size 20M;
    include       /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    A LOT MORE SETTINGS...</pre>

Yes, just add <code>client_max_body_size</code> and restart your webserver. This by default is 1M, so anything beyond this will be refused.
