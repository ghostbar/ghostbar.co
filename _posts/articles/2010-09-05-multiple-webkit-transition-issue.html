While making a CSS layout for a client I had issues with transitions on WebKit-based browsers, I couldn't make it renderize more than one transition at the same time with the short <code>-webkit-transition</code>, the line was:
<pre>-webkit-transition: background-color .25s linear, shadow .25s linear;</pre>

Doesn't works on Safari 3 nor in Google Chrome 6 so I tried splitting out the lines to:
<pre>-webkit-transition-property: background-color, shadow; 
-webkit-transition-duration:.25s, .25s; 
-webkit-transition-timing-function: linear, linear;</pre>

And now it works! But it sucks, now I have to write three stupid lines instead of one for the same thing, something that works perfectly on Firefox4 and the draft says explicitly it should work, just:
<pre>-moz-transition: background-color .25s linear, shadow .25s linear;</pre>

Well, at least works...
