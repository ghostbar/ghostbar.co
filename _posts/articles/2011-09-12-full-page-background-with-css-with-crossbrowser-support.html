I've been trying to get the perfect full-page background without using JavaScript since a while. I tried with CSS3 but, obviously for IE <9 was a pain in the ass, even for older Firefox' releases. So I decided to go with the plain-CSS option:

<code lang="html">
<!doctype html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <img id="bg" src="/img/bg.jpg">

  <p>Content</p>
</body>
</html></code>

<code lang="css">
img#bg {
  min-width: 100%;
  min-height: 100%;
  
  /* Proportionate re-dimension */
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;

  position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0;

  z-index: -1;
}
</code>
<h3>What does it does?</h3>
It takes an inline image and uses it as if were a <code no_cc="true">background-image</code> thanks to the <code no_cc="true">z-index: -1</code> CSS-rule.

There are lots of other techniques at <a href="http://css-tricks.com/3458-perfect-full-page-background-image/">CSS-Tricks</a> but none works in every browser as this one in particular.

Enjoy.
