It seems like there's no way to <a href="http://ghostbar.ath.cx/2009/12/12/chrome-font-rendering-engine-on-x11/">have Chrome's font-rendering engine on Firefox</a> and that's a shame. I do love how Chrome renders all the webs. Maybe is something on webkit side, and it would be good to have all that Firefox Minefield has with Chrome's rendering...

It's a shame Gecko doesn't seems to have a nice way to give this. But at least it does render more websites than Firefox like <a href="http://matthewbuchanan.name/">http://matthewbuchanan.name/</a> which I cannot render on Chrome 4.0.249.30.
