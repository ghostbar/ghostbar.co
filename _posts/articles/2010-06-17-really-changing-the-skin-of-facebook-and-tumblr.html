There's a lot of fake groups telling they will say to you how to change the skin of facebook if you accept to join a group where they'll ask you to share a lot of your info and invite all your friends before they reveal you <em>the secret</em>.

There's no secret, just go to <a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/browse/facebook.com">UserStyles.org for Facebook</a> and select + install the style you want.

You can use it with Tumblr too, just go to <a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/browse/tumblr.com">UserStyles.org Tumblr section</a>.

And <strong>stop sharing your info freely on the net</strong>!
