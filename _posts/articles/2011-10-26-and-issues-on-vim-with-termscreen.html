Because of tmux I run with $TERM="screen" instead of my regular rxvt-unicode, but I had a big issue with VIM because of this, it kept writing and F\n and H\n each time I pressed <End> and <Home> keys respectively. I finally found the way to solve this, making VIM use $TERM="xterm" internally writing this on my ~/.vimrc:
<code>if &term == "screen"
  set term=xterm
endif</code>

So, this way, even in my servers without XTerm installed (but ncurses-term) I can use VIM as I'm used to.
